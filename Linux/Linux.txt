Exercise 1 - Extracting data using cut command
-------------------------------------------------
	The filter command cut helps us extract selected characters or fields from a line of text.

	1.1 Extracting characters.

	The command below shows how to extract the first four characters.

	1
	echo "database" | cut -c1-4
	
	You should get the string ‘data’ as output.

	The command below shows how to extract 5th to 8th characters.

	1
	echo "database" | cut -c5-8
	
	You should get the string ‘base’ as output.

	Non-contiguous characters can be extracted using the comma.

	The command below shows how to extract the 1st and 5th characters.

	1
	echo "database" | cut -c1,5
	
	You get the output : ‘db’

	1.2. Extracting fields/columns

	We can extract a specific column/field from a delimited text file, by mentioning

	the delimiter using the -d option, or
	the field number using the -f option.
	The /etc/passwd is a “:” delimited file.

	The command below extracts user names (the first field) from /etc/passwd.

	1
	cut -d":" -f1 /etc/passwd 
	
	The command below extracts multiple fields 1st, 3rd, and 6th (username, userid, and home directory) from /etc/passwd.

	1
	cut -d":" -f1,3,6 /etc/passwd 
	
	The command below extracts a range of fields 3rd to 6th (userid, groupid, user description and home directory) from /etc/passwd.

	1
	cut -d":" -f3-6 /etc/passwd 


Transforming data using tr.
----------------------------------------
	tr is a filter command used to translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters.

	2.1. Translate from one character set to another

	The command below translates all lower case alphabets to upper case.

	echo "Shell Scripting" | tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]" 
		fuzz@pizza:~$ echo "Shell Scripting" | tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]"
		SHELL SCRIPTING
	You could also use the pre-defined character sets also for this purpose:


	echo "Shell Scripting" | tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]" 
	
	The command below translates all upper case alphabets to lower case.

	echo "Shell Scripting" | tr  "[A-Z]" "[a-z]" 
	
	2.2. Squeeze repeating occurrences of characters

	The -s option replaces a sequence of a repeated characters with a single occurrence of that character.

	The command below replaces repeat occurrences of ‘space’ in the output of ps command with one ‘space’.

	ps | tr -s " "
	
	In the above example, the space character within quotes can be replaced with the following : "[:space:]".

	2.3. Delete characters

	We can delete specified characters using the -d  option.

	The command below deletes all digits.

	echo "My login pin is 5634" | tr -d "[:digit:]"
	
	The output will be : ‘My login pin is’
	
	
ls:
----
	Option	Description
	-a	list all files, including hidden files
	-d	list directories only, do not include files
	-h	with -l and -s, print sizes like 1K, 234M, 2G
	-l	include attributes like permissions, owner, size, and last-modified date
	-S	sort by file size, largest first
	-t	sort by last-modified date, newest first
	-r	reverse the sort order
	
find:
------
	The find command is used to search for files in a directory. You can search for files based on different attributes, such as the file's name, type, owner, size, or timestamp.

	The find command conducts a search of the entire directory tree starting from the given directory name.

	For example, the following command finds all .txt files in the /etc directory and all of its subdirectories:

	find /etc -name \'*.txt\' 
	Note: Along with listing all the .txt files, the terminal may return "Permission denied" errors.
	These errors are normal, as you have limited access permissions on the lab machine.	
	
wget:
-----
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0250EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Bash%20Scripting/usdoi.txt


curl:
-----
fuzz@pizza:~/wgetUrl$ curl www.google.com -o google.txt

Create and manage file archives:
--------------------------------
	tar

	The tar command allows you to pack multiple files and directories into a single archive file.

	The following command creates an archive of the entire /bin directory and writes the archive to a single file named bin.tar.

	The options used are as follows:

	Option	Description
	-c	Create new archive file
	-v	Verbosely list files processed
	-f	Archive file name
	
	tar -cvf bin.tar /bin
	
	To see the list of files in the archive, use the -t option:

	tar -tvf bin.tar
	
	To untar the archive or extract files from the archive, use the -x option:
	
	tar -xvf bin.tar
	
	Use the ls command to verify that the folder bin is extracted.


	ls -l
	
Package and compress archive files:
------------------------------------
	zip

	The zip command allows you to compress files.

	The following command creates a zip file named config.zip consisting of all the files with extension .conf in the /etc directory.

	zip config.zip /etc/*.conf

	The -r option can be used to zip an entire directory.

	The following command creates an archive of the /bin directory.
	
	zip -r bin.zip /bin

Extract, list, or test compressed files in a ZIP archive:
---------------------------------------------------------
	unzip

	The unzip command allows you to extract files.

	To list the files of the archive config.zip, enter the following:

	unzip -l config.zip

	The following command extracts all the files in the archive bin.zip.

	unzip -o bin.zip

	We added the -o option to force overwrite in case you run the command more than once.

	You should see a folder named bin created in your directory.
